Plan/ideas

Engine idea:

Supply user (game developer) with a framework for coding games, taking some of the low level
complexity out of the equation for them. API should be simple but based in reality.

Components:
- Renderer
    - Camera
    - Lighting
- Audio player
- Math lib
- UI system
- Entity system
- Input system
- Asset system

Immediately necessary:
- Utility stuff
    - General purpose allocator
    - Math lib or write our own
    - Read config files (avoid magic numbers at start, maybe nitpicking...)

- Renderer (initially based on data from DearImGui)
- Event system
    - Really not sure how to structure this yet
